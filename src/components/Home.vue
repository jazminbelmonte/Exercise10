    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Jazmin. I am 19 and a senior at Weber State with a major in
      Web and User Experience and a minor in Computer Science. The dream however,
      is to one day be in the film industry, preferably as a director, but honestly
      i'll take what I can get. For now all I can do is try to get my foot in the door
      by looking for projects and web developing internships and getting a head start
      in my career. In this app i'll let you know what some of my favorite movies and
      and also some of my favorite movie quotes. I have hundreds of favorites, but I
      have picked a few of the best ones.</p>
